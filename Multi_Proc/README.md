multiproc 
------------------------------------------------------------

command:
> python multiproc foldername

Note: Put your folder(s) in same directory as all codes (multiproc.py, pWhite_multi.py, pTarget_multi.py, read_positions.py) and the 'files' folder.

When running the code, you should be able to select the image containing the white standard from within your folder and then select 
the ROI (white area) from this selected image (does not have to be named 'white').

Output: foldername_PROC folder containing all XXXX.final.v and XXXX.RGB16.v files and a file, foldername_3D.txt, file containing position info for each cube.
